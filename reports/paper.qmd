# Introduction

This Quarto document is a placeholder for your analysis report.  You can
embed text, code chunks, and figures.  The pipeline defined in
`_targets.R` should generate all necessary intermediate data; in this
document you can read those data via the targets API or by loading
files under `data/processed/`.

```{r}
#| label: use-targets
# Read a target produced by the pipeline (run after tar_make)
summary_tbl <- targets::tar_read(manifest_summary)
summary_tbl
```
