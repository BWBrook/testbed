title: Development Notes

This repository is a generic R compendium template.

Conventions:

- Dependencies managed with `renv`; do not commit large data.
- Pipeline with `{targets}`; helpers live in `R/` and are sourced via `tar_source("R")`.
- Use `import::from()` inside functions; avoid `library()` calls.
- Tests in `tests/testthat/` with table-driven cases.
- Small example data under `inst/extdata/`.

Common tasks (run in RStudio Console):

```r
renv::restore(prompt = FALSE)
source("dependencies.R")
pak::pkg_install(project_dependencies())
devtools::document()
testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat", reporter = "summary")
targets::tar_make()
pkgdown::build_site(preview = FALSE)
```
